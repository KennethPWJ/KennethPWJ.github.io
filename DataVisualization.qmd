## 🎯 Project Overview

<div class="project-overview">
In this project, my classmate and I were paired with three students from the science school. Our mission was to develop an innovative solution to help <span class="highlight">reduce food waste in Singapore</span>.
</div>

## 💡 Our Solution

<div class="solution-box">
  <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #2196F3;">♻️ From Waste to Wellness</h3>
  <p>We developed a sustainable hand sanitizer by collecting:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sugarcane resin</strong> from local sugarcane stores</li>
    <li><strong>Orange peels</strong> from iJooz outlets</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These materials were transformed into an effective hand sanitizer, marketed during the COVID-19 period to meet the high demand for hygiene products.</p>

## 📊 Survey Insights

  </p>
</div>

### Key Findings

The data visualization above reveals important consumer feedback regarding:

- **Scent preferences**: Whether customers preferred scented or unscented formulations
- **Product consistency**: Consumer opinions on the desired liquidity/texture of the hand sanitizer

These insights guided our product development to better align with market demands.
